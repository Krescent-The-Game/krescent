## Game Story

The challenge's theme is called Moonshot! So we figured "let's do a running game on the moon".
This game is inspired by Ad Astra's moon pirate chasing scene where our hero is riding a Lunar Roving Vehicle(LRV or simply a buggy) and the pirate vehicle is chasing.

During the trail, there are obstacles to avoid like a hidden mines and floating moondusts. The best score will be saved when the buggy's health bar has dropped to zero or pirate vehicle has caught up to our hero's buggy.
